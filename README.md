I have taken on various jobs in media and digital services before applying to Makers Academy as my next career move.
Graduating from a web development bootcamp has been a great asset in my understanding of product/web development; I am now working as a product manager for EngineerBetter, Cloud Foundry specialists.

#### Collaborative/Communication skills

 - My partner-facing role at vevo (2014-2017) has also been the opportunity to be instrumental to the success of the company's operations by being at the crossroads between our music partners and our engineering teams, providing technical support and maintaining quality business relationships.

- You will also see me at various meetups and events around London: it's always great to meet new people in the industry over a drink and make new contacts in the community!
